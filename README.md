README: njRAT 0.7d Horror Edition
Project Name: njRAT 0.7d Horror Edition
Version: 0.7d (Horror Branch)
Platform: .NET Framework (Windows)

Introduction
This repository contains the njRAT 0.7d Horror Edition, a highly modified and weaponized fork of the classic Bladabindi (njRAT) remote administration tool. Unlike its predecessor—which primarily focused on surveillance and remote access—this iteration is engineered for psychological dominance, system disruption, and demonstrative impact. It integrates legacy remote access capabilities with enhanced "horror" modules designed to intimidate, destabilize, and assert control over target systems.

The tool functions as a dual‑purpose payload: it retains standard RAT functionalities (remote desktop, keylogging, credential harvesting) while introducing destructive and harassment features that push it into the realm of cyber‑psychological operations. Its interface provides granular control over compromised machines, making it a comprehensive—though now largely dated—suite for penetration testing in controlled environments, forensic analysis of historical malware, and academic study of cyber‑threat evolution.

Disclaimer: This tool is published STRICTLY FOR EDUCATIONAL, RESEARCH, AND LEGITIMATE PENETRATION‑TESTING PURPOSES within fully authorized and isolated environments. Unauthorized use against any system without explicit permission is illegal and unethical.
